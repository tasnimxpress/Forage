# Data Analytics and Visualization Job Simulation

## Accenture North America Data Analytics and Visualization Job Simulation on
### Forage - August 2024

 * Completed a simulation focused on advising a hypothetical social media client
   as a Data Analyst at Accenture
 * Cleaned, modeled, and analyzed 7 datasets to uncover insights into content
   trends to inform strategic decisions
 * Prepared a PowerPoint deck and video presentation to communicate key insights
   for the client and internal stakeholders
   
I participated in Accenture’s Data Analytics & Visualization job
simulation on the Forage platform, and it was incredibly useful to understand
what it might be like to participate in a typical project team at Accenture, and
to use Excel data analytics and visualization skills in a realistic
context. 
I use Excel functions, Formula, and Pivot tables to prepare a final dataset and create a dashboard. 
Through this program, I really enjoy cleaning, modeling, and
analyzing client data, creating slides to communicate findings, and presenting insights back to the client.

# Based on our analysis,
- Animals consistently lead in popularity, indicating a strong, sustained user interest, significantly leading with a 74,965 reaction score.

- Science and Technology are stable favorites, showing increasing interest in technology.

- We saw Healthy Eating increased engagement in 2020, possibly due to the pandemic. However, food was always there in the top 5. You can use this insight to create a campaign with food and healthy eating to boost user engagement.

- The appearance of Culture in 2021 indicates shifting interests and trends over time.
